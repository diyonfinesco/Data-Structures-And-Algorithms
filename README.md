## What is Data Structures and Algorithms
Data structures is a way we can store data in different structures. Algorithms are about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures. 

When comes to software engineering field we could say data structures and algorithms like wheel ðŸ›ž and fire ðŸ”¥ because we solved so many problems with these innovations. like that data structures and algorithms are fundamental knowledge and as software engineers we should know about these structures and algorithms. 

In my opinion, we do not want to memorize all of these by line to line. but we should have an idea about what are different data structures and algorithms and also where we can use them. because we can easily use these to solve different kind of problems very easily.
